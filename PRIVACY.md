# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 1, 2025**

## Overview

Advanced Tab Control is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension operates entirely locally on your device and does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.

## Data Collection

**We do NOT collect any data.**

This extension:
- ✅ Does not collect personal information
- ✅ Does not track your browsing history
- ✅ Does not monitor the websites you visit
- ✅ Does not collect usage analytics or statistics
- ✅ Does not use cookies or tracking mechanisms
- ✅ Does not transmit any data to external servers

## Data Storage

The extension stores your settings locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage API:

- **Settings Stored:** Tab behavior preferences, site-specific rules, and debug mode settings
- **Storage Location:** Local device storage and Chrome Sync (if you have Chrome Sync enabled)
- **Access:** Only you and the extension have access to these settings
- **Control:** You can clear all extension data at any time through Chrome's extension settings

If you have Chrome Sync enabled, your extension settings will sync across your Chrome browsers where you're signed in. This is a Chrome feature, not controlled by this extension.

## Permissions Explanation

The extension requires the following permissions to function:

- **`tabs`** - Required to manage tab order and activation when closing tabs
- **`storage`** - Required to save your preferences (stored locally on your device)
- **`scripting`** - Required to inject scripts that handle link click behavior
- **`host_permissions` (<all_urls>)** - Required to apply site-specific settings on any website you visit

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and not for data collection.

## Third-Party Services

**We do not use any third-party services.**

- ❌ No analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics)
- ❌ No advertising networks
- ❌ No crash reporting services
- ❌ No external APIs or servers
- ❌ No social media integrations

## Data Sharing

**We do not share any data because we do not collect any data.**

### Certification

I certify that:
- ✅ I do not sell or transfer user data to third parties
- ✅ I do not use or transfer user data for purposes unrelated to the extension's single purpose (tab management)
- ✅ I do not use or transfer user data to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:

- **View Settings:** Access your settings through the extension's options page
- **Export Settings:** Use the export feature to save your settings to a file
- **Delete Data:** Remove the extension to delete all stored settings
- **Clear Specific Settings:** Delete individual site-specific rules through the options page

## Changes to Extension Code

All extension code is open for review. You can inspect the source code to verify:
- What data is accessed
- How your settings are stored
- That no external connections are made
